# My first website

### [Live version](https://james-glennon.github.io/first-project-second-attempt/)

Welcome! [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

This test project displays links to the [wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) pages describing the tools I will be using as part of my full-stack developer course with Code Institute.

The site includes three webpages, each with a navigation bar with links to the other two pages and a link to themselves.

The website displays the links for each of these resources as a uniformly sized icons with their name below.

The webpages link to a CSS stylesheet which edit the font, navigation bar and the appearence of hyperlinks.
