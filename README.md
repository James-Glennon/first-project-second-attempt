# My first website

 [Live version](https://james-glennon.github.io/first-project-second-attempt/)

Welcome! [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

This test project displays links to the [wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) pages describing the tools I will be using as part of my full-stack developer course with Code Institute.

The site includes three webpages, each with a navigation bar with links to the other two pages and a link to their own web address.

The website displays the links for each of these resources as uniformly sized icons with their name below.

The webpages link to a CSS stylesheet which edit the font and navigation bar.

## Known Issues

The link used of GitPod does not link to wikipedia as no appropriate [wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=gitpod&go=Go&ns0=1) was found. Instead, this icon links to the [about gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/about/) page availible on the tool providers website.
